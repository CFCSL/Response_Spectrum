The response spectrum shall be calculated using the peak ground acceleration coefficient and the spectral acceleration coefficients scaled by the zero-, short- and long-period site factors, $F_{pga}$, $F_a$ and $F_v$ respectively.

st.markdown("""
Horizontal elastic response spectra are calculated and plotted for two recommended types (Type 1 and Type 2) and for ground types A to E (5% damping). However, for vertical seismic (EN 1998-1:2004 (E)), all 5 ground types A, B, C, D and E have the same vertical spectrum.
